# wfa_Terminal
I developed a project for managing a bus and car terminal as a practice exercise. The project includes the essential features of a terminal, and it is implemented using C# and SQL Server. The connection between the application and the database is established through ADO.NET, and operations are performed using stored procedures. This project is designed as a Windows Forms application.
